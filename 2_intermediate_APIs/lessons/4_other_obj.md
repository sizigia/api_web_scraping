## Other Objects

In addition to users, the GitHub API includes a few other types of objects. For example, `https://api.github.com/orgs/dataquestio` will retrieve information about the Dataquest organization on GitHub. `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World` will give us information about the `Hello-World` repository that the user `octocat` owns.

GitHub offers full [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/) for all of the API's endpoints.
