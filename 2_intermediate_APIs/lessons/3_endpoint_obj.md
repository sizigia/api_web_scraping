## Endpoints and Objects

APIs usually let us retrieve information about specific objects in a database. On the previous screen, for example, we retrieved information about a specific user object, `VikParuchuri`. We could also retrieve information about other GitHub users through the same endpoint. For example, `https://api.github.com/users/torvalds` would get us information about [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).
