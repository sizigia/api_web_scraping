## Finding the Number of People in Space

OpenNotify has one more API endpoint, `astros.json`. It tells us how many people are currently in space. You can find the format of the responses [here](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/).

Because we implement our own version of this API on our servers, this number will most likely be different from the current number (when you try to access the original API outside of Dataquest).
